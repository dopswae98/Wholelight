**Challenge Statement**

Creating an ecommerce website for cellphones and accessories can be a challenging task, but it has the potential to significantly improve the customer experience. By providing a platform where customers can access reviews and leave their own feedback, the retailer can build trust and credibility with its users. This, in turn, can lead to increased sales and customer loyalty. Additionally, by allowing customers to create accounts and save their preferences, the website can help to foster a sense of community and personalization, further enhancing the overall shopping experience.

**Risks**
* Technical risk: Security attack on the customer database.
* Non-technical risk: Insincere reviews.

**Infrastructure**
* Since this is an individual project, all the work will be done on the master branch.
* The project will use containers for deployment.
* Cloud deployment

**Existing Solutions**
* ebay.com. Edmunds is one of the more popular car review websites, with an average of 16 million unique visitors per month. Edmunds offers in-depth reviews from professional car reviewers as well as everyday drivers
